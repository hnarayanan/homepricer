# Estimating property prices in the U.K. with Gaussian Processes

This repository contains code that goes along with an upcoming blog
post on [my personal website][personal-website]. Together, they act as
a systematic look at a statistical model called [the Gaussian
Process][wiki-gaussian-process], and use it to estimate future
property prices in the U.K. The blog covers the underlying theory, and
the code in this repository encompasses a web application (in Django)
that helps load historical transaction information, visualise it
(using D3) and predicts future prices using a Gaussian Process model
in TensorFlow.
