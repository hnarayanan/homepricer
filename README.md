# Estimating property prices in the U.K. with Gaussian Processes

This repository contains code that goes along with an upcoming blog
post on [my personal website][personal-website]. Together, they act as
a systematic look at a statistical model called [the Gaussian
Process][wiki-gaussian-process], and use it to estimate future
property prices in the U.K. The blog post covers the underlying
theory, and the code in this repository encompasses a (Django) web
application that helps load historical transaction information and a
Gaussian Process model (in TensorFlow) that predicts future
prices. The web application uses OpenStreetMap to visualise
historical pricing data and future predictions.
